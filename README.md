# üß† Visa Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine the likelihood of visa approval based on candidate and job-related features. The goal is to assist in automating parts of the visa evaluation process by leveraging data-driven insights and machine learning models. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model tuning, this project demonstrates the workflow of developing an end-to-end classification model.

## üéØ Objectives
- Understand key factors influencing visa approvals.
- Perform in-depth univariate and bivariate analysis of applicant and job attributes.
- Apply data preprocessing, feature selection, and model tuning.
- Compare different classification algorithms and evaluate their performance.
- Identify the most significant predictors contributing to visa approval.

## üß© Key Methods
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and winsorizing outliers.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Univariate and bivariate analyses to uncover variable distributions and relationships.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Transformation and selection based on importance scores.  
- **Model Development:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting (before and after hyperparameter tuning).  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy.
